These pages demonstrate the various uses of the Geo-PKO dataset using RStudio. This includes simple commands to extract and visualise information from the dataset. A large portion of these scripts and/or similar scripts have been used to put together the [Geo-PKO visualisation platform](https://geopko.shinyapps.io/geopkodashboard). 

As the icon "workflowr" with the green check shows on each page, we have built the documents using [eponymous R package](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr). This is to ensure that the code is highly reproducible, and we encourage readers to explore the raw code behind these documents on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geopko/Geo-PKO-R).

For more information on the dataset, please consult the project's [homepage](https://www.pcr.uu.se/data/geo-pko/) on the Uppsala University website. When using the data, please cite:
