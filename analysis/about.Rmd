These pages demonstrate the various uses of the Geo-PKO dataset using R. This includes simple commands to extract information from the dataset and visualization. A large portion of these scripts have also been used to put together the Geo-PKO Shiny app (add link here). 

For more information on the dataset, please consult the [official homepage](https://www.pcr.uu.se/data/geo-pko/).
