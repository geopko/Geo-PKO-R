These pages demonstrate the various uses of the Geo-PKO dataset using RStudio. This includes simple commands to extract and visualise information from the dataset. A large portion of these scripts and/or similar scripts have been used to put together the [Geo-PKO visualisation platform](https://geopko.shinyapps.io/geopkodashboard). 

For more information on the dataset, please consult the project's [homepage](https://www.pcr.uu.se/data/geo-pko/) on the Uppsala University website.
