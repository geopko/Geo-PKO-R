This document contains a series of steps that the project members have performed to explore the Geo-PKO dataset. 

Load packages.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```
Import the dataset. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message =FALSE}
GeoPKO <- read_csv("data/geopko.csv")
```

Now we can start with the actual fun stuff! Let's have a quick look at the first few rows of the dataset.
 
```{r}
head(GeoPKO)
```
